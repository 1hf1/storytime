Starting in July 2020, it has been the world's most valuable automaker. From October 2021 to March 2022, Tesla was a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. company to reach that valuation. Tesla exceeded $1 trillion in market capitalization again between November 2024 and February 2025. In 2023, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 19.9% share. Also in 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the *Forbes* Global 2000.... Tesla has been the subject of lawsuits, boycotts, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk including overpromising on the company's driving assist technology and product release timelines. Opponents of Musk have launched the \"Tesla Takedown\" campaign in response to the views of Musk and his role in the second Trump presidency.... This led to significant delays and production problems, a period which the company described as \"production hell\". By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and the Model 3 became the world's best-selling electric car from 2018 to 2021.... This period of \"production hell\" put significant financial pressure on Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most shorted companies in the stock market. On August 8, 2018, amid the financial issues, Musk posted on social media that he was considering taking Tesla private. The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much controversy and many lawsuits including a securities fraud charge from the SEC, which would force Musk to pay a $20 million fine and step down as the company's chairman, although he was allowed to remain the CEO.... ### Global expansion and Model Y (2019\u2013present)\nFrom July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500. During 2020, its share price increased 740%, and by December 14, 2020, its market capitalization was more than the next nine largest automakers combined, and it became the sixth most valuable company in the US. Tesla was added to the S&P index on December 21, 2020; it was the most valuable company ever added, and was the sixth-largest member of the index immediately after it was added.... After the announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped around 12%. Tesla CEO Elon Musk later noted that Tesla would resume bitcoin payments if there was confirmation of at least 50% clean energy usage by bitcoin miners. Despite later reaching this milestone, Tesla did not return to accepting bitcoin. By July 2022 Tesla had sold about 75% of its bitcoin holdings at a loss, citing that the cryptocurrency was hurting the company's profitability.... Between May 2023 and February 2024, almost all major North America EV manufacturers announced plans to switch to Tesla's North American Charging Standard adapters on their EVs by 2025, which is expected to be a stable source of recurring revenue for Tesla. In November, Tesla started shipping the Cybertruck, produced from Gigafactory Texas.... In December 2024, a Delaware court rejected Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package from Tesla, ruling that it was not properly approved by the company's board. The decision arose from a lawsuit by Tesla shareholders who claimed the compensation was excessive and not aligned with performance metrics.... By February 2025, Tesla saw large decreases in its stock price and sales across Europe widely attributed to Elon Musk's political advocacy and embrace of far-right politics. Polling found that Musk's ties to United States President Donald Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency were strongly correlated to decreasing views of Tesla, and triggered multiple protests, vandalism, gunfire, and arson at Tesla stores and charging stations.... By March 7, Tesla's stock had decreased every week for seven straight weeks since Musk joined the Trump administration, making it the longest losing streak for Tesla in 15 years as a public company. On March 29, over 200 protests against Tesla were held worldwide.... On April 15, 2024, Tesla secured a deal with Tata Electronics to supply semiconductor chips, marking a significant step in Tesla's expansion into India's automotive market.\n\nOn May 2, 2024, Tesla announced that it has abandoned its plan for next-generation gigacasting, a cutting-edge manufacturing technique. Initially aiming to revolutionize production and reduce costs, Tesla has now opted for its more proven method of casting vehicle underbodies in three pieces. This strategic shift reflects the company's focus on self-driving vehicles and adjusting to market challenges.... ## Technology\n\nTesla is highly vertically integrated and develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.\n\nTitle: TSLA Performance Report for Tesla Stock - Barchart.com\nURL: https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/tsla/performance\nSnippet: #### [[ header ]]\n\n[[ ::error ]]\n\n[[ ::error ]]\n\n|Period|Period Low|Period High|Performance|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|5-Day|383.76 +12.09% on 11/21/25||432.93 -0.64% on 11/28/25|+34.94 (+8.84%)since 11/20/25|... |1-Month|382.78 +12.38% on 11/14/25||474.07 -9.26% on 11/03/25|-30.38 (-6.60%)since 10/28/25|\n|3-Month|325.60 +32.12% on 09/02/25||474.07 -9.26% on 11/03/25|+84.19 (+24.33%)since 08/28/25|... |6-Month|273.21 +57.45% on 06/05/25||474.07 -9.26% on 11/03/25|+73.27 (+20.53%)since 05/28/25|\n|YTD|214.25 +100.78% on 04/07/25||474.07 -9.26% on 11/03/25|+26.33 (+6.52%)since 12/31/24|... |52-Week|214.25 +100.78% on 04/07/25||488.54 -11.95% on 12/18/24|+97.28 (+29.22%)since 11/27/24|\n|2-Year|138.80 +209.92% on 04/22/24||488.54 -11.95% on 12/18/24|+183.45 (+74.36%)since 11/28/23|... |3-Year|101.81 +322.52% on 01/02/23||488.54 -11.95% on 12/16/24|+235.31 (+120.76%)since 11/28/22|\n|5-Year|101.81 +322.52% on 01/02/23||488.54 -11.95% on 12/16/24|+230.49 (+115.43%)since 11/30/20|... |10-Year|9.40 +4,474.65% on 02/01/16||488.54 -11.95% on 12/01/24|+414.82 (+2,702.29%)since 11/01/15|",
