But reasons for the selloff go well beyond the social media company. WSJ\u2019s Sean McLain explains.\n\nPhoto illustration: Amber Bragdon/Getty Images\n\n#Tesla #ElonMusk #WSJ... (all laughing)\n{ts:14} - [Narrator] Since the deals\nclosed in late October, Tesla shares have slipped\nending the year down 65%. The company's worst year on record.\n{ts:21} But the reason for the selloff\ngoes far beyond Twitter. Here's what drove Tesla... investors away in 2022, and what's affecting the\ncar maker going into 2023.\n{ts:31} Let's start with demand. For years, Tesla has\nstood out as the leader in the electric vehicle space,\n{ts:37} and while its dominance continued in the third quarter of 2022, its market share slipped to 61%.... {ts:58} - [Narrator] According to JD Power, there were 33 EV models\navailable in the US at the end of 2021, but by the end of 2022\n{ts:66} that number had jumped to 53 models. Tesla still held four of the top five selling... EVs last year according\n{ts:73} to S&P Global Mobility. But the sell-off in Tesla shares reflects investors' fear\nthat its hold won't last\n{ts:80} as newer models arrive. - Tesla has sold the same\nsort of handful of models for years now, and the question is... {ts:86} will Tesla continue to be as competitive as it has in the past or\nwill they become outdated? - [Narrator] Further fueling concerns\n{ts:93} are customer wait times for Tesla cars, which dropped sharply over 2022. Some investors see this as a sign\n{ts:100} demand is already softening.... Musk addressed these concerns on Tesla's third quarter earnings call.\n{ts:105} - [Musk] I can't emphasize enough. We have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell\nevery car that we make\n{ts:116} as far into the future as we can see. - [Narrator] And in December, the CEO said on a Twitter Spaces call... that demand pressures\n{ts:122} were driven by rising\ninterest rate policies. Production disruptions also contributed to the stock slide last year\n{ts:129} leading to Tesla missing its full year vehicle delivery target. The EV makers said it\ndelivered 1.3 million vehicles\n{ts:136} in 2022, up 40% from 2021.... That was shy of its goal\nof increasing deliveries by 50% or more.\n{ts:143} It would've needed more than\n1.4 million to hit that target. News of the shortfall pushed stocks down another 12% to start the new year.\n{ts:152} Its largest single day decline... in more than two years. Intermittent factory closures at Tesla's China plant,\nits largest by volume,\n{ts:159} were one part of the problem. - China's zero COVID policy led to a number of shutdowns\nat its factory in Shanghai,\n{ts:165} which obviously created\nsupply issues of its own. - [Narrator] Tesla also... mover in that market. Its valuation was driven\nin part by its CEO\n{ts:257} and some investors say Musk's promises about future vehicles\nhave pushed shares higher though many of the cars\ndidn't come until years later.\n{ts:266} The latest example, Tesla's cyber truck, which was first unveiled three years ago and still hasn't hit the market.... {ts:272} - Cyber truck is gonna be awesome. It's worth the wait. Believe me. - [Narrator] And more directly,\n{ts:277} Musk's move to offload\nbillions in Tesla stock in part related to Twitter, has pushed down Tesla's share price.\n{ts:283} - Anytime anybody sells $40... third quarter earnings call, Musk said that he sees the EV company as recession resilient.\n{ts:324} - [Musk] Let's say 2023 is\na brutal recession year. Even then, we generate meaningful cash. - [Narrator] Tesla investors\nare now waiting for later\n{ts:334} this month when the car maker will report its full year earnings,... which could give a glimpse of the stock's prospects\nfor the coming year.\n{ts:340} (upbeat music)\n\nTitle: Tesla Stock Returns By Year\nURL: https://www.statmuse.com/money/ask/tesla-stock-returns-by-year\nSnippet: |ASSET|YEAR|% RETURN|\n|--|--|--|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|2010|40.15%|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|2011|6.4%|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|2012|17.04%|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|2013|329.8%|... |Tesla (TSLA)|2014|48.47%|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|2015|7.69%|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|2016|-7.38%|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|2017|44.91%|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|2018|6.67%|... |Tesla (TSLA)|2019|36.66%|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|2020|731.18%|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|2021|46.89%|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|2022|-67.8%|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|2023|109.74%|... |Tesla (TSLA)|2024|61.48%|\n|Tesla (TSLA)|2025|10.27%|\n1.
