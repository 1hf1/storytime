After months of mutual animosity, President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani met for the first time in a widely anticipated meeting late last week.

The newly friendly relationship is likely temporary, but still \\\\u201cremarkable,\\\\u201d says Ross Barkan, who is writing a book about Mamdani\\\\u2019s rapid political rise. \\\\u201cIf Trump is less antagonistic towards Mamdani, the idea is to have Trump do as little damage as possible to New York City,\\\\u201d Barkan says of Mamdani\\\\u2019s conciliatory approach to the meeting. \\\\u201cHe\\\\u2019s not going to attack. He\\\\u2019s going to try to build coalitions.\\\\u201d... ### Transcript\\\\n\\\\n{ts:0} This is democracyow democracynow.org the Warren Peace Report. I\\'m Amy\\\\n{ts:5} Goodman. President Trump and New York mayor elect the Democratic socialist Oran Mandani met Friday at the White\\\\n{ts:12} House in the Oval Office for the first time.... Over the past several months, both Trump and Mamani have harshly criticized\\\\n{ts:20} each other. Trump\\'s called Mamani a communist lunatic and a quote Jew hater. Trump had also threatened to send the\\\\n{ts:28} National Guard to New York and cut off billions of dollars in federal funding to New York City if Mamani was elected.... {ts:37} Meanwhile, Mani has described Trump as a fascist and a desperate. Many of Trump\\'s supporters had criticized Trump for\\\\n{ts:44} inviting Mamani, who will soon become New York\\'s first Muslim and South Asian mayor. The far-right conspiracy theorist\\\\n{ts:54} Laura Loomer said it was quote wild to allow a jihadist communist to stand behind the president\\'s desk in the Oval... Um, are you claiming to retract any of these remarks in order to improve\\\\n{ts:209} your relationship? I think both President Trump and I, we are very clear about our positions and\\\\n{ts:215} our views. And what I really appreciate about the president is that the meeting that we had focused not on places of... {ts:520} City. That was the goal of the meeting. So so far for Mandani so good. We\\'ll see what happens next.\\\\n{ts:526} I mean it\\'s very interesting. I want to go back to President Trump\\'s meeting with Mdani.\\\\n{ts:533} We discussed ICE and New York City and I spoke about how the laws that we have in New York City allow for New York City... It had been\\\\n{ts:716} introduced this resolution about a month ago, but the Republicans decided to bring it on the floor Friday morning. Um\\\\n{ts:723} the response that Zoron Mamdani had to this is um that he\\'s a democratic socialist. Talk about the meaning of\\\\n{ts:730} this and the scores of Democrats including the uh House Minority Leader um uh the House Minority Leader Hakee... I don\\'t think enough members of\\\\n{ts:919} DSA nor Mani were one over. During the White House press conference, uh Zuron Mdani was asked about Israel\\\\n{ts:926} and Gaza. You accused the US government of committing genocide in Gaza while... {ts:932} President Trump was working on peace. Why? Why that? I I\\'ve spoken about the Israeli government committing genocide\\\\n{ts:938} and I\\'ve spoken about our government funding it. And I shared with the president in our meeting about the\\\\n{ts:943} concern that many New Yorkers have of wanting their tax dollars to go towards the benefit of New Yorkers and their... {ts:989} It\\'s actually quite remarkable and and I thought it got overshadowed in that meeting. The headlines are all about how\\\\n{ts:997} well the two men got along and how much Trump liked Mamani. But the fact that Zoran Mani went and stood inside the\\\\n{ts:1004} White House and called what Israel did to Gaza a genocide is it would have been unthinkable even a year ago.... I mean I mean this is really a moment I do think we\\'ll look back on as as a time when politics\\\\n{ts:1035} truly shifted in this country. Um because Mammani did not back down. And also Trump did not criticize him for\\\\n{ts:1044} saying that. And that\\'s the other part of this that really jumped out to me.\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Watch Trump and Mamdani\\'s full remarks in the Oval Office\\\\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/video/trump-mamdani-oval-office-full-digvid\\\\nSnippet: In the Oval Office, President Donald Trump engaged in discussions New York Mayor-electohrandani, with both individuals describing the encounter as \\'constructive.\\' Trump remarked that despite having previously criticized Mamdani as a \\'communist,\\' they could collaborate on issues such as crime, housing, and the rising cost of living in New York.\\\\n--- Search Query: Donald Trump Zohran Mamdani meeting --- \\\\n\\\\nTitle: President Trump Meets with Zohran Mamdani, Mayor-Elect, New York City\\\\nURL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDanzN1EUeE\\\\nSnippet: The meeting focused on various topics, including public safety and cost of living issues.

You both have differences when it comes to ICE agents\\nin New York City. Mr.... have you spoken to President Zelensky,\\nor do you intend to speak? The President: I\\'ve spoken\\nwith their people. We have a plan. It\\'s horrible\\nwhat\\'s happening --\\n{ts:571} it\\'s a war that should\\nnever have happened. It would never have happened\\nif I was president, and it\\'s a shame.... that this deal -- The President: You mean that\\nhe doesn\\'t like it? The Press: It\\'s unclear.\\nHe was sort of --\\n{ts:762} The President: He\\'ll have\\nto like it, and if he doesn\\'t like it,\\nthen you know, they should just\\nkeep fighting, I guess.... You know. The Press: The suggestion\\nthat you made, though, was that if he doesn\\'t\\naccept it, that the U.S. would pull back\\nits support for Ukraine. The President: Well,\\nat some point he\\'s going to have\\nto accept something. You know, he hasn\\'t accepted. You remember,... we\\'re talking about a mother and her two children,\\n{ts:968} how this has very little\\nto do with what that is. The President: What we did is,\\nwe discussed crime. More than ICE, per se,\\nwe discussed crime. And he doesn\\'t want\\nto see crime, and I don\\'t want to see crime,... every New Yorker can afford. The President: Please go ahead. The Press: Mr. Mamdani,\\nanti-Israel protesters just targeted a synagogue\\nin New York. Are you concerned about\\nJewish New Yorkers feeling welcome and safe\\nin the city?

Mamdani, who ran on policies including rent freezes and city-run grocery stores to cut food prices, has vowed to use his face-to-face meeting with Trump to make a \"case for New Yorkers\" who are struggling to pay $2.90 in bus fees. \\n\\nMamdani said that he had initiated the meeting with Trump \"because I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than 8.5 million people who call the city home.\"... You said   that you would be his worst  nightmare and accused him of   having  a fascist agenda. Um, \\n{ts:200} are you planning  to  retract  any of these remarks? I think  both  the president Trump and  I,  we  are very  clear about  our positions and our views.... And what  I really   appreciate  about the  president,  is  that  the  meeting that we had focused,   not on  places  of   disagreement, which there are  many, and also  focused on... That\\'s   another thing.  I think we   have  in  common  we  want to  see peace in the  Middle   East  and we  actually  have  \\n{ts:316} now for the first time, peace  in  the Middle  East  after  3,000 years and now we\\'re  going to  refine  it. and  I think you\\'re  going to  see  some  very  positive  things   happen.... {ts:353} they  wanted  an  end to   Forever Wars. They  wanted   an  end to  the taxpayer   dollars.  we  had funding  violations  of  human rights   and they  wanted  to  address  the cost  of  living  crisis.... So,  we\\'re going to  work   together. We\\'re going to   make  sure  that  if  \\n{ts:425} there there are horrible   people  there,  we  want to  get them  out.  I think he   wants to  get them  out,   maybe more  than  I do, so   we\\'ll work  together, we   discussed it.... {ts:590} nicely. uh  yeah  we  have  a  a way of  Getting peace,  or   we  think we  have  a way of   getting peace.  He\\'s   going to  have  to  approve  it. Just so.  Many  people,  you know, last  They  lost   25,000  soldiers. this  is,  something we  haven\\'t seen   anything  like  this, since... He he\\'ll  have   to  like  it. have  if  he   doesn\\'t like  it  then   you know  they  should  just   keep  fighting, I guess,  you  know, Is that if? Free. Well, \\n{ts:776} at  some  point,  he\\'s   going to  have  to  accept   something,  you know.  he hasn\\'t accepted.... You  remember, right in  the Oval   Office. not so  long  ago.   uh, I said  you don\\'t have   the cards.  Don\\'t forget  I  inherited this  War I would  have  never this  war.  Never  would have  happened. I  inherited this  war and I  thought he  should  have   made  a deal.... Mr. What we did?  We  just   discussed crime.  more  than   ice per se.

However, few meetings have sparked as much excitement as his encounter with York City-elect Zran Mamani on Friday afternoon.\\n\\nMany anticipated a confrontation between the president and the young, rising democratic socialist, whom Republicans are eager to portray as their 2026 nemesis. Instead, the meeting turned out to be quite the opposite.... Among Trump\\'s remarks: When a reporter pointed out that Trump had warned of cutting funding to New York City if Mamdani took office, the president indicated he might use that tactic if necessary, but also minimized its likelihood. \"I expect to be helping him, not hurting him,\" Trump stated.... Most compliments flowed from Trump toward Mamdani, while Mamdani refrained from attacking Trump. Instead of addressing their disagreements, he frequently redirected the conversation to his main focus: affordability. When questioned about his assertion that the U.S. government was complicit in what he termed an Israeli genocide in Gaza, Mamdani did not shy away but swiftly transitioned back to the topic of affordability.... Towards the conclusion of the meeting, a reporter inquired whether New York City had affection for Trump. While Mamdani did not go that far, he did offer Trump a positive note. \"I tell you there were New Yorkers for President in the recent presidential because of that focus on cost of living,\" he remarked, adding, \" I\\'m forward to together to on that affordability agenda.\"... The ongoing affordability crisis is compelling Trump to dramatically revise his economic strategy on the fly. \\n\\nMoreover, it wasn\\'t just the kind words exchanged that stood out; it appeared as though Trump was defending his new ally. When a reporter asked Mamdani about his previous characterization of Trump as a \"fascist,\" Trump essentially gave him the green light to express such views. \"That\\'s ok. You can just say yes,\" Trump remarked. \"That\\'s easier. It\\'s easier than explaining.\"... Similarly, when it was mentioned that Mamdani had referred to Trump as a despot, Trump interjected, \"\\'ve been much worse a des.\" When asked about Mamdani\\'s critiques of Trump\\'s deportation policies, Trump downplayed their significance in their dialogue, despite deportations being a major concern for him in New York City this year. \" doesn\\'t to see, and don\\'t want to see crime,\" Trump stated. \" I have little doubt we\\'re gonna get along on that issue.\"... So what explains this unexpected camaraderie? It seems to reflect a pattern we\\'ve seen with Trump in the past. Even when he politically opposes someone, he appears to respect their resolve and success. Currently, Mamdani is perceived as a winner.... Mamdani is also clearly an adept politician thriving in a region that Trump values highly. It’s not surprising that Trump would appreciate a charismatic, skilled politician from Queens. Additionally, there may be a strategic element at play; the White House could have preferred to avoid a conflict with Mamdani, especially since he has excelled on an issue where Trump is struggling: affordability and living costs. Engaging in a confrontation with Mamdani, who has a disciplined message, might have been seen as a risk.... However, the friendly atmosphere could have political repercussions. The meeting contrasted sharply with expectations and how Republicans had framed the event. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt remarked, \"It volumes that we have communist coming the White House,\" referring to Mamdani, who was as the of the city in nation. Vice President JD Vance humorously suggested he might feign illness to avoid meeting Mamdani. GOP Senator Rick Scott of Florida labeled Mamdani a \"literal communist\" and anticipated he was \" his way the White to beoled by President Trump.\"... Yet, the outcome was quite different from what they had anticipated. This situation is perplexing given that Republicans have spent considerable time suggesting they would link Democrats to Mamdani\\'s political stance. Democrats appeared wary of this association, evident in their hesitance to endorse him.\\n\\nThis meeting was the GOP\\'s prime opportunity to establish a stark contrast between Trump’s agenda and what they describe as the communism infiltrating the national Democratic Party. Trump effectively undermined that strategy.... While it does not mean the GOP will completely abandon this narrative, the optics are diminished when Trump is on camera alongside Mamdani, emphasizing their shared interests and hinting that conservatives might find him more agreeable than expected. Trump even dismissed a common GOP criticism that labeled Mamdani a \"jihadist.\" When asked if he concurred New York gubernatorial Rep.ise Stefanik\\'s remarks, he replied, \"No, I don\\'t.\" He added, \"She\\'s out there campaigning, and you say things sometimes in a campaign.\"... It seems Trump is not keen on allowing the GOP\\'s attacks on Mamdani to be taken too seriously. The most intriguing question now is whether any conservatives will challenge Trump for giving this so-called communist jihadist an unqualified pass.', name='perplexity_search', id='640908a9-90f7-4583-8db3-ea70f14bf259', tool_call_id='call_P1fKnBsV6t739pX8eKzSWDig'),\n",

Amna: Our white house correspondent Liz landers joins... {ts:47} us now from the white house. What happened today in that oval office meeting and what was\\n{ts:54} behind the change in tone we saw, especially from president trump?\\n{ts:56} Liz: Today was quite the turn of events after these two men have been trading barbs through the... {ts:62} media for months now. Resident trump calling mamdani a communist.\\n{ts:69} Mamdani calling the president a deficit. They plan to work together in\\n{ts:79} the future today. Mamdani\\'s spokesperson said this was a customary type of meeting,\\n{ts:86} that the mayor of America\\'s largest city would meet at the white house with the president,... {ts:91} and they were hoping to focus on public safety, economic security, and affordability.\\n{ts:96} It was that last part we heard over and over from these two men.\\n{ts:101} Affordability. Throughout this whole oval office meeting today, it was\\n{ts:105} quite a different tone, especially from president trump.... {ts:130} happened was mamdani got a question from a reporter about the fact that he has made\\n{ts:137} comments likening president trump to a fascist in the past. Mamdani started to explain\\n{ts:142} himself and president trump stepped in from the resolute desk saying, it is ok, you can... {ts:149} just say yes, it is easier than explaining, the president also coming to mamdani\\'s defense\\n{ts:156} trying to explain this for him. Just an unusual set up we saw there.\\n{ts:160} Amna: Some remarkable moments. What can you share with us about what the meeting focused on?... {ts:171} Liz: It largely focused on affordability, after those special elections at the\\n{ts:178} beginning of the month where a lot of voters voted in the ballot box and said the economic\\n{ts:185} issue of affordability is their top issue right now. We heard that would be deadly.... {ts:190} President trump saying he hopes to work with mamdani about lowering the cost of rent in new\\n{ts:196} York City, building additional housing units. They talked about getting con\\n{ts:203} Edison, the energy provider, getting those prices down. Mamdani echoing this as well.... {ts:228} threatened to withhold federal funding for New York City for projects like infrastructure\\n{ts:234} projects, public safety, hospitals, etc. Today, he seemed to back off\\n{ts:241} that a little bit. He was asked about that threat in particular and he said, look,... {ts:246} I don\\'t want to send money to New York if it is being used in ways I don\\'t agree with but he\\n{ts:251} said that after today that was not what he thought would happen.\\n{ts:256} Amna: They both indicated they would like to move to -- work together moving forward.... {ts:267} Ny indication of what that might look like? Liz: The president recognized\\n{ts:273} there are topics they will not disagree on. Resident trump said he would\\n{ts:279} feel comfortable living in mamdani\\'s New York City under his leadership after this\\n{ts:285} meeting today, but one more thing when we are looking ahead to the midterm elections in... {ts:291} 2026. It will be very difficult for Republicans to tie the entire\\n{ts:298} democratic party to mamdani\\'s policies when we see that president trump agreed with much\\n{ts:302} of what mamdani was talking about and many of these policies seem to find common ground on.\\n\\nTitle: Analysis: 4 takeaways from the bizarrely chummy Trump-Mamdani meeting\\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/takeaways-zohran-mamdani-trump-oval-office-new-york\\nSnippet: President Donald Trump\\'s Oval Office gatherings have become must-see events during his second term.

The most intriguing question now is whether any conservatives will challenge Trump for giving this so-called communist jihadist an unqualified pass.\\n\\nTitle: Trump, Mamdani make love — not war\\nURL: https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/21/trump-mamdani-make-love-not-war-00665861\\nSnippet: Indeed, the interaction between Mamdani and the voluble president shocked the political world.\\nIt was a surreal scene: The president, who belittled Mamdani as \\'my little communist,\\' and the incoming New York City mayor, who blasted Trump in his election night victory speech as a fascist, smiling together, occasionally patting each other on the elbow.... \\'I think this mayor is going to be doing some things that are really great,\\' Trump said.\\nThe president marveled at the interest, too, musing at one point, \\'The press has eaten this thing up.

Among his initiatives is the establishment of New York City\\'s inaugural universal childcare program, the elimination of fares for city buses, and a freeze on rent for 1 million tenants benefiting from rent stabilization.... Additionally, he has suggested imposing a tax on the wealthiest citizens of the city and raising the corporate tax rate to fund these policy measures, although his detractors argue that these ideas are impractical. Should he be elected mayor, Mamdani would require approval from the state legislature and the governor for any tax increases. New York Governor Kathy Hochul, who has endorsed Mamdani, has expressed her opposition to tax hikes for the affluent, citing concerns that such measures could drive business leaders out of the state.... Mamdani\\'s policy proposals have sparked both enthusiasm and doubt throughout the campaign. The cost of childcare in New York City has reached a critical point, making it one of the most expensive places globally for such services. His plan aims to provide free childcare for children aged 6 weeks to 5 years and to enhance existing pre-K and 3-K programs initiated during Bill de Blasio\\'s tenure. To finance this initiative, Mamdani proposes taxing high-income earners and corporations. Critics, including Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa, argue that the necessary funding will be insufficient.... Buses have become a focal point of Mamdani\\'s campaign, with plans to build on a pandemic-era pilot program and abolish fares entirely on all city buses. He also intends to expand dedicated bus lanes to improve travel times for buses. The funding for this free bus initiative would come from increasing the corporate tax rate in the state and imposing higher income taxes on residents earning over $1 million annually.... Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, now running as an independent, has criticized this proposal, labeling it as \"unnecessary benefits to wealthy New Yorkers who can afford bus fares.\" Instead, Cuomo advocates for subways buses free the lowest residents.... In addition, Mamdani envisions establishing government-sidized stores, in each borough of New York City. This particular proposal has stirred controversy, with some critics likening it to food rationing reminiscent of Soviet times. Mamdani describes his initiative as a \"public option for produce,\" asserting that these government stores would tackle soaring food prices by utilizing city-owned land, purchasing food at wholesale rates, and exempting store owners from property taxes....

He campaigned on an affordability-focused platform supporting fare-free city buses, universal public child care, city-owned grocery stores, a rent freeze on rent-stabilized units, additional affordable housing units, and a $30 minimum wage by 2030.... He also expressed support for LGBTQ rights, comprehensive public safety reform, and tax increases on corporations and those earning above $1 million annually. He won the Democratic primary in June 2025, defeating former governor Andrew Cuomo in an upset, and was elected mayor in the November general election.... ## Mayor of New York City\\n\\n### 2025 campaign\\n\\nOn October 23, 2024, Mamdani announced his candidacy for mayor of New York City. His platform included support for free city buses and a rent freeze in rent-stabilized housing. Mamdani also wants the city government to operate five grocery stores—one in each borough—to drive down grocery prices. His platform included support for universal child care and the construction of 200,000 new affordable housing units. He also supports public safety reform and a $30 minimum wage by 2030. His platform called for tax increases on corporations and those earning above $1 million annually.... During the primary, Mamdani\\'s campaign was supported by the *New Yorkers for Lower Costs* super PAC, which spent approximately $1.3 million supporting him and opposing Cuomo before the primary and raised an additional $1 million afterward. The super PAC received $100,000 in contributions from the Unity and Justice Fund in May and June 2025. Cuomo accused Mamdani of accepting \"dirty money\", saying the Unity and Justice Fund was tied to the Council on American-Islamic Relations.... After Mamdani won the primary, criticisms of and attacks against him used racist, xenophobic, and Islamophobic tropes, particularly references to the 9/11 attacks and terrorism. These criticisms and attacks came from across the political spectrum, and sparked concern and debate over Islamophobia in mainstream American politics.\\n\\nIn early November, President Donald Trump threatened to withdraw federal funding for New York City should Mamdani be elected mayor. Mamdani was elected mayor on November 4, 2025. He will be the city\\'s youngest mayor since 1892, as well as the city\\'s first Indian American and Muslim mayor.... Mamdani identifies as a democratic socialist, and is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. Described as a progressive and left-wing populist, his policies have been characterized as left-wing. His economic platform centers on equity and affordability—supporting debt relief for taxi medallion owners, stronger rent control, tenant protections, and a Social Housing Development Agency to build 200,000 affordable units.... In New York City, he advocates raising the local minimum wage to $30 by 2030, implementing higher taxes on corporations and high-income earners to fund free tuition at CUNY and SUNY, universal childcare, city-owned grocery stores, and free public transit, while cutting taxes for outer-borough homeowners and reforming New York\\'s property tax system.... Mamdani supported Proposal 1—a successful 2024 ballot measure that banned discrimination based on ethnicity, gender identity, disability, and reproductive rights—and backs single-payer healthcare through the New York Health Act. He argues that \"dignified work, economic stability, and well-resourced neighborhoods\" prevent harm better than policing, proposing a civilian Department of Community Safety to handle mental health crises and community outreach.... He has voiced support for defunding the NYPD and accused the department of racism, for which he later apologized. As a mayoral candidate, he instead emphasized building a cooperative relationship with the department on violent crime prevention while reducing the involvement of police in other matters.... He co-sponsored the \"Not on our dime!\" bill to stop New York charities from funding Israeli settler violence. After the October 7 attacks, Mamdani mourned all victims, condemned Hamas\\'s attacks as war crimes, and called for both sides to \"lay down their arms\" while advocating a permanent ceasefire and the end of Israeli occupation and ethnocratic policy in favor of \"equal rights for all\". He said he would try to honor the International Criminal Court\\'s warrants for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian president Vladimir Putin if they visit New York City.... Mamdani connects environmental justice to social equity. He opposed expansion of the gas-fired Astoria Energy power plant, supports the All-Electric Buildings Act and congestion pricing, and proposed a \"Green Schools for a Healthier New York City\" plan to retrofit schools with solar panels, create green schoolyards, and establish resilience hubs. His platform includes universal pre-K, baby baskets for new families, defending Hasidic yeshivas\\' autonomy, expanding sanctuary protections for immigrants, making NYC an LGBTQ+ sanctuary city with an Office of LGBTQIA+ Affairs, and eliminating bus fares through expanded MTA funding and free transit initiatives.', name='perplexity_search', id='013f04a6-4976-4657-89be-3811dc5c6de4', tool_call_id='call_vPQ5gJ039Pj1Pr3tdaGnw7Yd'),\n",

The two struck a friendly tone and President Trump told reporters that he \\'hopes\\' they meet again.\\r\\n--------... That anything I do is going to be good for New York. If I can get prices down, it\\'s good for New York. And we\\'ve got them down way down from from\\n{ts:48} last year. We have uh as you know I\\'ve been saying to a lot of people Walmart said that Thanksgiving this year is exactly 25% less than last year.... Congratulations, Mr. Mayor. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. I appreciate it. Please. I appreciated the the meeting with the\\n{ts:84} president, and as he said, it was a productive meeting focused on a place of shared admiration and love, which is New York City, and the need to deliver affordability to New Yorkers, the 8 and a half million people who call our city their home, who are struggling to afford life in the most expensive city of the United States of America.... We spoke about\\n{ts:103} rent. We spoke about groceries. We spoke about utilities. We spoke about the different ways in which people are being pushed out. And I appreciated the time with the president. I appreciated the conversation. I look forward to working together to deliver that affordability for New Yorkers. Thank you very much.... And frankly, that is something that could transform the lives of the 8 and a half million people who are currently struggling under a cost of living crisis with one in four living in poverty. And the meeting came back again and again to what it could look like to lift those\\n{ts:231} New Yorkers out of struggle and start to deliver them a city that they could do more than just struggle to afford it, but actually start to live in it.... Well, I actually told the president that, you know, so much of the focus of our campaign has been on the cost of\\n{ts:457} living crisis. And when we asked those New Yorkers who had voted for the president when we saw an increase in his numbers in New York City that came back to the same issue, cost of living, cost of living, cost of living....

And that\\'s where I am really looking forward to delivering for New Yorkers in partnership with the\\n{ts:489} president on the affordability agenda. And I think we have to work a little bit.... President,\\n{ts:805} Mr. President, cost of living is something that you and Mr. Mandami seem to agree on. Uh, Democrats have run New York City for a long time. Mr. Do you see Democrat policy specifically as being a problem? And I\\'d like that be a question that both of you could answer.... {ts:1042} because what we see right now in New York City is a system that is so inequitable that it can\\'t even stand up in court. And the president and I spoke about the importance of not only building more housing, but also making sure that regulation of housing is something that is manageable to actually get through and not the cause of yet... Why? Why that? I I\\'ve spoken about the Israeli government committing genocide and I\\'ve spoken about our government funding it. And I shared with\\n{ts:1347} the president in our meeting about the concern that many New Yorkers have of wanting their tax dollars to go towards the benefit of New Yorkers and their ability to afford basic dignity.... {ts:1437} New York City, and I keep my horizons firmly on New York City, and I appreciate the the meeting with the president, which focused again on the five burrows and and whether New Yorkers could afford to live there. By the way, being the mayor of New York City is a big deal.... I appreciate that. Mr. President, you say you love New York City, Mr. Maldani. Does New York City\\n{ts:1473} love President Trump? New York City loves a future that is affordable. And I can tell you that there were more New Yorkers who voted for President Trump in the most recent presidential election because of that focus on cost of living. and I\\'m looking forward to working together to deliver on that affordability agenda.\\n\\nTitle: Analysis: 4 takeaways from the bizarrely chummy Trump-Mamdani meeting\\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/takeaways-zohran-mamdani-trump-oval-office-new-york\\nSnippet: President Donald Trump\\'s Oval Office gatherings have become must-see events during his second term. However, few meetings have sparked as much excitement as his encounter with York City-elect Zran Mamani on Friday afternoon.\\n\\nMany anticipated a confrontation between the president and the young, rising democratic socialist, whom Republicans are eager to portray as their 2026 nemesis. Instead, the meeting turned out to be quite the opposite.... Among Trump\\'s remarks: When a reporter pointed out that Trump had warned of cutting funding to New York City if Mamdani took office, the president indicated he might use that tactic if necessary, but also minimized its likelihood. \"I expect to be helping him, not hurting him,\" Trump stated.... Most compliments flowed from Trump toward Mamdani, while Mamdani refrained from attacking Trump. Instead of addressing their disagreements, he frequently redirected the conversation to his main focus: affordability. When questioned about his assertion that the U.S. government was complicit in what he termed an Israeli genocide in Gaza, Mamdani did not shy away but swiftly transitioned back to the topic of affordability.... Towards the conclusion of the meeting, a reporter inquired whether New York City had affection for Trump. While Mamdani did not go that far, he did offer Trump a positive note. \"I tell you there were New Yorkers for President in the recent presidential because of that focus on cost of living,\" he remarked, adding, \" I\\'m forward to together to on that affordability agenda.\"... The ongoing affordability crisis is compelling Trump to dramatically revise his economic strategy on the fly. \\n\\nMoreover, it wasn\\'t just the kind words exchanged that stood out; it appeared as though Trump was defending his new ally. When a reporter asked Mamdani about his previous characterization of Trump as a \"fascist,\" Trump essentially gave him the green light to express such views. \"That\\'s ok. You can just say yes,\" Trump remarked. \"That\\'s easier. It\\'s easier than explaining.\"... Similarly, when it was mentioned that Mamdani had referred to Trump as a despot, Trump interjected, \"\\'ve been much worse a des.\" When asked about Mamdani\\'s critiques of Trump\\'s deportation policies, Trump downplayed their significance in their dialogue, despite deportations being a major concern for him in New York City this year. \" doesn\\'t to see, and don\\'t want to see crime,\" Trump stated. \" I have little doubt we\\'re gonna get along on that issue.\"... So what explains this unexpected camaraderie? It seems to reflect a pattern we\\'ve seen with Trump in the past. Even when he politically opposes someone, he appears to respect their resolve and success. Currently, Mamdani is perceived as a winner.... Mamdani is also clearly an adept politician thriving in a region that Trump values highly. It’s not surprising that Trump would appreciate a charismatic, skilled politician from Queens. Additionally, there may be a strategic element at play; the White House could have preferred to avoid a conflict with Mamdani, especially since he has excelled on an issue where Trump is struggling: affordability and living costs. Engaging in a confrontation with Mamdani, who has a disciplined message, might have been seen as a risk.... However, the friendly atmosphere could have political repercussions. The meeting contrasted sharply with expectations and how Republicans had framed the event. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt remarked, \"It volumes that we have communist coming the White House,\" referring to Mamdani, who was as the of the city in nation. Vice President JD Vance humorously suggested he might feign illness to avoid meeting Mamdani. GOP Senator Rick Scott of Florida labeled Mamdani a \"literal communist\" and anticipated he was \" his way the White to beoled by President Trump.\"... Yet, the outcome was quite different from what they had anticipated. This situation is perplexing given that Republicans have spent considerable time suggesting they would link Democrats to Mamdani\\'s political stance. Democrats appeared wary of this association, evident in their hesitance to endorse him.\\n\\nThis meeting was the GOP\\'s prime opportunity to establish a stark contrast between Trump’s agenda and what they describe as the communism infiltrating the national Democratic Party. Trump effectively undermined that strategy.... While it does not mean the GOP will completely abandon this narrative, the optics are diminished when Trump is on camera alongside Mamdani, emphasizing their shared interests and hinting that conservatives might find him more agreeable than expected. Trump even dismissed a common GOP criticism that labeled Mamdani a \"jihadist.\" When asked if he concurred New York gubernatorial Rep.ise Stefanik\\'s remarks, he replied, \"No, I don\\'t.\" He added, \"She\\'s out there campaigning, and you say things sometimes in a campaign.\"... It seems Trump is not keen on allowing the GOP\\'s attacks on Mamdani to be taken too seriously. The most intriguing question now is whether any conservatives will challenge Trump for giving this so-called communist jihadist an unqualified pass.\\n\\nTitle: Mamdani: Will Be \\'RELENTLESS\\' On Solving NYC Affordability Crisis In Trump WH Meeting | TRENDING\\nURL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nBIsz5SxUI\\nSnippet: ## The Hill\\n##### Nov 20, 2025 (0:02:48)\\nNYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani on Thursday told reporters that he will push for lowering the cost of living in New York City in his meeting with President Trump at the White House.... ### Transcript\\n\\n{ts:0} I know that for tens of thousands of New Yorkers, this meeting is between two\\n{ts:4} very different candidates who they voted for for the same reason. They wanted a leader who would take on the cost of\\n{ts:10} living crisis that makes it impossible for working people to afford living in this city.... My team reached out to the\\n{ts:18} White House to set up this meeting because I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than 8\\n{ts:24} 12 million people who call this city home. I have many disagreements with the president and I believe that we should... {ts:31} be relentless and pursue all avenues and all meetings that could make our city affordable for every single New Yorker.\\n{ts:39} I intend to make it clear to President Trump that I will work with him on any agenda that benefits New Yorkers. If an\\n{ts:47} agenda hurts New Yorkers, I will also be the first to say so.... This is an opportunity to make the case for New\\n{ts:53} Yorkers. And it\\'s a case that reflects what New Yorkers are having to live through at this time. When we speak\\n{ts:60} about an affordability crisis, we\\'re speaking about one in four New Yorkers living in poverty. One in five... {ts:66} struggling to afford $2.90 to ride the bus. New Yorkers for whom the daily acts of life are becoming increasingly harder\\n{ts:74} to afford. And that\\'s an opportunity I have to make the case to President Trump, to the White House as to what it\\n{ts:82} means to have to suffer through this affordability crisis and what it means... {ts:87} to make it even more difficult to do so. You know, last year after the president won his second term, I went to two of\\n{ts:96} the neighborhoods that saw the largest swings towards Republicans, and that was Hillside Avenue in Queens and Form Road\\n{ts:103} in the Bronx.... And when I asked those New Yorkers who they voted for and why, I met many who voted for President Trump\\n{ts:110} and they told me it was the affordability crisis. It was cost of living, cost of living, cost of living.\\n{ts:115} And they said that they remembered being able to afford their rent, their child care, their KED, their public transit... {ts:120} more 4 years ago than they could in that moment. And we ran a campaign focused on the same thing, cost of living. And what\\n{ts:128} we found actually is that one in 10 New Yorkers who voted for Trump ended up voting for our campaign. and they did so... {ts:134} because they\\'re looking for leaders to actually deliver on the cost of living crisis. That\\'s why everything comes back\\n{ts:141} to making the case for an affordability agenda. I will meet with anyone. I will speak to everyone so long as it can\\n{ts:147} stand to benefit an economic agenda for New Yorkers.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s where I will always make the case.\\n\\nTitle: Analysis: 4 takeaways from the bizarrely chummy Trump-Mamdani meeting\\nURL: https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/takeaways-zohran-mamdani-trump-oval-office-new-york\\nSnippet: President Donald Trump\\'s Oval Office discussions have turned into must-see events during his second term. However, few meetings have sparked as much curiosity as his recent encounter with York City-elect Zran Mamani on Friday afternoon.\\n\\nMany anticipated a confrontation between the president and the emerging democratic socialist figure, whom Republicans have indicated they would like to portray as their 2026 antagonist. Contrary to expectations, the meeting unfolded quite differently.... Here are some key insights from this unexpectedly friendly gathering.\\n\\nWhile some had speculated that this outcome was possible, it was still surprising, particularly coming from Trump. Journalists persistently posed questions highlighting their disagreements and the harsh remarks they had exchanged previously. Yet, both men consistently deflected the opportunity for conflict, focusing instead on their shared interests.... Among Trump\\'s remarks, when a journalist pointed out his earlier threat cut funding New York if Mamani assumed office, the president implied he might use that threat if necessary but downplayed its likelihood. \"I expect to be helping him, not hurting him,\" Trump stated.... The flow of compliments predominantly came from Trump toward Mamdani, who seemed to hold back his criticisms of the president. Instead of engaging in disputes, Mamdani redirected conversations to his primary concern: affordability. When questioned about his previous assertion that the U.S. was comp in an Israeli genocide Gaza, Mamdani did not shy away but quickly shifted back to discussing affordability.... As the event progressed, a reporter inquired whether New York City loved Trump. While Mamdani didn\\'t fully endorse that sentiment, he did offer Trump a compliment. \"I tell you there were New Yorkers for President in the recent presidential because of that focus on cost of living,\" Mamdani remarked, expressing eagerness to collaborate on the affordability agenda.... The affordability crisis is compelling Trump to significantly adjust his economic strategy on the fly. However, it wasn\\'t merely the mutual praise that stood out; it appeared that Trump was almost defending his new ally. When a reporter asked Mamdani about his previous labeling of Trump as a \"fascist,\" Trump essentially gave him the green light to continue such rhetoric. \"That\\'s ok. You can just say yes,\" Trump said. \"That\\'s easier. It\\'s easier than explaining.\"... Similarly, when it was mentioned Mamd had called a des, Trump responded, \"\\'ve been much worse a des.\" In response to inquiries about Mamdani\\'s critiques of Trump\\'s deportation actions, Trump insinuated that it wasn\\'t a significant topic in their discussion, despite deportations being a major concern for him in New York City this year. \" doesn\\'t to see, and don\\'t want to see crime,\" Trump stated. \" I have little doubt we\\'re gonna get along on that issue.\"... So, what accounts for this unexpected camaraderie? It seems to reflect a recurring theme with Trump: even when he disagrees with someone politically, he appears to respect political resilience and success. Right now, Mamdani represents a success story.... Mamdani is undoubtedly a skilled politician thriving in a region of the country that Trump values. It’s not surprising that Trump would appreciate a charismatic and capable leader from Queens. Additionally, there may be a strategic element at play; the White House might have wanted to avoid a contentious interaction with Mamdani, especially given his success on the very issue—affordability—where Trump is currently struggling.... However, this friendly exchange could have political repercussions. The atmosphere was starkly different from what many had anticipated and how Republicans had promoted the event. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt remarked, \"It volumes that we have communist coming the White House,\" referring to Mamdani as the new mayor of the largest city in the nation. Vice President JD Vance humorously suggested he might avoid meeting Mamdani due to a supposed stomach issue.... GOP Senator Rick Scott of Florida labeled Mamdani a \"literal communist\" and predicted he was \" his way the White to beoled by President Trump.\" Yet, the outcome was far from that expectation.\\n\\nInterestingly, this meeting did not align with the narrative Republicans had been promoting for weeks, which aimed to connect Mamdani’s politics with the broader Democratic agenda. This was the GOP\\'s first significant chance to establish a contrast between Trump\\'s policies and the alleged communism within the national Democratic Party. Trump’s demeanor undermined that strategy.... While it doesn’t mean the GOP will abandon this approach entirely, having Trump on video alongside Mamdani, emphasizing their commonalities and suggesting that conservatives might be pleasantly surprised by him, complicates the narrative. Trump even dismissed a familiar GOP attack that Mamdani is a \"jihadist,\" stating, \"No, I don\\'t,\" in response to a question about remarks made by York GOPatorial candidate. El Stefanik. \"She\\'s out there campaigning,\" Trump explained, \"and you say things sometimes in a campaign.\"', name='perplexity_search', id='b00ed5be-e264-4c99-8b37-7b206df0bd24', tool_call_id='call_YByxxcclmZMmANAyhf7ADiHa'),\n",
