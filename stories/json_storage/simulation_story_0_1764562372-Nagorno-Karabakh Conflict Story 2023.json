Azerbaijan seizes Nagorno-Karabakh. **The aftershocks of the collapse of the Soviet Union continue to be felt three decades later. The countries that emerged from the Soviet collapse had borders that often didn\u2019t align with where national groups lived\u2014sowing the seeds for conflict. The Nagorno-Karabakh enclave in Azerbaijan, for instance, was populated almost entirely by ethnic Armenians uninterested in being governed by Baku.... In late 1991, Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence, triggering a war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. When the fighting ended in 1994 with a Russian-brokered ceasefire, Nagoro-Karabakh had gained de facto independence along with a chunk of Azerbaijani territory. Despite intermittent cross-border attacks, the ceasefire held until large-scale fighting erupted in September 2020.... After six weeks, Russia negotiated another ceasefire. This one left Azerbaijan in control of much of Nagorno-Karabakh. Tensions remained high. In September 2023, Azerbaijan attacked again. Within days, it overran the territory it did not already control and announced it would begin the enclave\u2019s \u201creintegration.\u201d... Within one week, more than one hundred thousand Armenians, or roughly 85 percent of the population of Nagorno-Karabakh, fled to Armenia. The exodus sparked protests in Armenia over its government\u2019s failure to protect fellow Armenians and raised questions about why Russia failed to prevent the enclave\u2019s demise. The safety of the remaining Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh could be a continuing flashpoint between Armenia and Azerbaijan. So too could the Zangezur Corridor, a small slice of Armenian territory that connects Azerbaijan with Nakhchivan, an Azerbaijani enclave bordered by Armenia, Iran, and Turkey.... **6. Civil war wracks Sudan**. Two thousand twenty-three was supposed to be the year that Sudan became a democracy. The Sudanese people instead got a civil war. The conflict had its roots in the protests that led Sudan\u2019s military in April 2019 to overthrow the country\u2019s longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir.... On April 15, 2023, RSF forces attacked SAF bases across the country. Efforts to negotiate a ceasefire went nowhere. By the fall, the RSF controlled most of Khartoum, Sudan\u2019s capital, while the SAF controlled Port Sudan, the country\u2019s main seaport. Fighting was particularly heavy in Darfur, where the Janjaweed, the RSF\u2019s predecessor, conducted an ethnic-cleansing campaign against the region\u2019s largely non-Arab population back in the early 2000\u2019s.... The incident inflamed political passions in the United States and prompted Blinken to postpone his visit to Beijing. Most troubling, Chinese officials refused to take a call from U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin after the balloon was shot down, highlighting the lack of an established communication channel between the two superpowers. Blinken finally travelled to Beijing in June for what State Department officials called \u201cconstructive\u201d talks.... **3. Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive gains little ground at a heavy cost.** Hopes were high early in 2023 that a Ukrainian counteroffensive might break Russia\u2019s hold on eastern Ukraine and possibly Crimea. The much-awaited counteroffensive began in early June. Despite inflicting massive losses on Russian troops, the battlelines barely moved.... Diplomatic conversations quickly turned to whether Ukraine could sustain, let alone win, a war of attrition that seemed to favor Russia given its substantially larger economy and population. Despite suffering horrific losses, Russia had double the number of troops in Ukraine in fall 2023 compared to the start of the invasion and the Russian economy was on a war footing.... **2. Hamas attacks Israel. **The Middle East looked promising in late September 2023. The Abraham Accords were deepening ties between Israel and Arab countries. Speculation abounded that Saudi Arabia might soon establish diplomatic relations with Israel. A ceasefire in Yemen\u2019s bitter civil war was holding. These trends prompted National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan to declare: \u201cThe Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades now.\u201d... That changed just eight days later, on October 7, when Hamas attacked Israel. Roughly 1,200 Israelis were killed, the deadliest day in Israel\u2019s history. Some 240 people were taken hostage. Vowing to eradicate Hamas, Israel launched airstrikes against Gaza and then invaded northern Gaza. A negotiated pause in the fighting at the end of November secured the release of roughly one hundred hostages.... But fighting soon resumed with Israeli troops moving into southern Gaza. The soaring death toll for Palestinian civilians, most of them women and children, fueled worldwide complaints that Israel was committing war crimes. Israel denied the charge, arguing that Hamas was using Palestinian civilians as human shields. Joe Biden unequivocally backed Israel\u2019s right to retaliate and traveled to Israel early in the conflict to show his support.\n\nTitle: 2023\nURL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023\nSnippet: - March 24\u201327 \u2013 A tornado outbreak kills at least 26 people in Mississippi and Alabama.

Some provided good news.\n{ts:4} Most provided bad news, from democracies in decline,\n{ts:7} to conflict and war, to a climate in peril. Here's a look back at the year that was\n{ts:12} with an eye toward how these events will shape the year to come.... {ts:61} in that we are now contesting a domain that just ten years earlier, 15 years earlier wasn't the case.\n{ts:67} And so we're really trying to build for a different what on a different timeline.\n{ts:72} Number Eight: India now has the most people of any country in the world.... {ts:93} The Chinese economy is about to become a machine for taking care of ancient parents and in-laws\n{ts:98} and that's going to make for big demands for social welfare benefits for older people.\n{ts:106} Demography isn't destiny, but it's close. Number Seven: Azerbaijan seizes Nagorno-Karabakh.... {ts:112} After years of unrest and upheaval. The war between Nagorno-Karabakh\n{ts:116} and Azerbaijan is finally over. Azerbaijan launched a lightning offensive\n{ts:121} against the Armenian enclave in Nagorno-Karabakh. The crushing Azerbaijani victory\n{ts:126} ended a three-decade-old war and triggered a mass exodus from Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.... {ts:132} Over a hundred thousand Armenians have fled the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh\n{ts:138} since September. And the question now is what happens to those hundred thousand\n{ts:142} living inside Armenia, as well as the larger question of whether a stable,\n{ts:147} sustainable peace can be created in this very volatile region.... Number Six: Civil war wracks Sudan.\n{ts:154} A bid by a paramilitary force to take power from the ruling Sudanese military\n{ts:159} plunged Africa's third largest country into a horrific civil war. Millions were displaced\n{ts:164} as diplomatic efforts to arrange a cease-fire went nowhere.... The conflict in Sudan\n{ts:169} is an absolute horror show for the Sudanese people. Sudan's potential\n{ts:174} disintegration here is incredibly destabilizing for an already really tough neighborhood.\n{ts:180} Number Five: AI evolved at a breathtaking speed in 2023. Doctors hope AI... It is becoming harder to define what is human\n{ts:204} because we are changing what is human. And AI\n{ts:207} is going to facilitate that faster than anything any of us have ever experienced.\n{ts:212} Number Four: U.S.-China tensions continue to simmer. Since President Nixon... {ts:262} heading into 2024, when there'll be elections in Taiwan\n{ts:266} and of course in the United States. There were some modest progress\n{ts:269} on issues like fentanyl and establishing military-to-military communications.\n{ts:274} But perhaps the most important outcome of the meeting was that the meeting itself took place.... {ts:278} Number Three: Ukrainians hoped that their summer counteroffensive would break through Russian defenses.\n{ts:283} But five months of fighting produced only meager territorial gains.\n{ts:287} As winter set in, the two countries seemed locked\n{ts:290} in a bloody war of attrition.",
