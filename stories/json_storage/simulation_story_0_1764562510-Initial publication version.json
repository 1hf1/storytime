Federalists cheered the triumph of national authority, while members of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Republican (later Democratic-Republican) Party were appalled by what they saw as government overreach. More than two centuries later, the names and faces have changed, but the story is ongoing.... ## 1810s: Battle of New Orleans (1815)\n\nOn January 8, 1815, a ragtag army under the command of Andrew Jackson decisively defeated British forces in the Battle of New Orleans, even though the War of 1812 had actually already ended. News of the Treaty of Ghent (December 24, 1814) had yet to reach the combatants. The American victory made a national figure of future president Jackson and contributed to the widespread perception that the U.S. had won the war, but in truth the conflict was effectively a draw, and the issues that had brought it on were largely unresolved.... ## 1840s: Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848)\n\nSigned on February 2, 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo brought to a close the Mexican-American War (1846\u201348) and seemingly fulfilled the Manifest Destiny of the United States championed by President James K. Polk by adding 525,000 square miles of formerly Mexican land to the U.S. territory.... ## 1850s: Dred Scott Decision (1857)\n\nThe 1850s were awash in harbingers of the American Civil War\u2014from the Compromise of 1850, which temporarily forestalled North-South tensions, to John Brown\u2019s Harpers Ferry Raid, which ramped them up. Arguably, though, by stoking abolitionist indignation in an increasingly polarized country, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Dred Scott decision set the table for the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln as president, which ultimately precipitated secession and war.... ## 1860s: Battle of Gettysburg (1863)\n\nIn July 1863, the year of the Emancipation Proclamation, in the small Pennsylvania crossroads town of Gettysburg, Robert E. Lee\u2019s invading Army of Northern Virginia sustained a defeat so devastating that it sealed the fate of the Confederacy and its \u201cpeculiar institution.\u201d Within two years the war was over, and before the end of the decade the South was temporarily transformed by Reconstruction.... ## 1870s: Battle of the Little Bighorn (1876)\n\nWhile the country celebrated its anniversary at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, on June 25, 1876, the 7th Cavalry under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer was vanquished by Lakota and Northern Cheyenne warriors led by Sitting Bull in the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Although it was a major victory for the Northern Plains people against U.S. expansionism, the battle marked the beginning of the end of Native American sovereignty over the West.... ## 1910s: Sinking of the Lusitania (1915)\n\nAs World War I raged in Europe, most Americans, including U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, remained determined to avoid involvement and committed to neutrality, though the U.S. economy had benefited greatly from supplying food, raw material, and guns and ammunition to the Allies. More than any other single event, the sinking of the unarmed British ocean liner, the *Lusitania*, by a German submarine on May 7, 1915 (killing, among others, 128 Americans), prompted the U.S. to join the war on the side of the Allies.\n\nTitle: US Historical Events from 1900 to Present\nURL: https://www.baylorschool.org/uploaded/Library_Resources_PDFs/US_History_US_Historical_Events_from_1900_to_Present.pdf\nSnippet: later dies from his wounds(Sept. 14).
