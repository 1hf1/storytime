Unfortunately, this attracted migrating emus. The large, flightless birds devastated the crops and became a regular nuisance. To deal with the issue, a small group of soldiers armed with automatic weapons were employed to wipe out the encroaching animals.... ## #8: New Atlantis Founded by Hemingway\u2019s Brother\n\n(1964-66)\nWhile Ernest Hemingway\u2019s time in the Caribbean has been much documented, and was of great interest to the F.B.I., his brother Leicester also took interest in the waters south of the U.S. Leicester founded a micronation in international waters off the coast of Jamaica. He created the \u201ccountry\u201d onboard a 30-foot raft in 1964.... \u201cNew Atlantis\u201d technically only constituted half the raft, as he claimed the other half belonged to the United States. Briefly inhabited by Leicester and a few others, he hoped to fund the operation through the sale of stamps and by attracting tourists. However, the micronation sank beneath the waves a few years after its founding. He probably jinxed it by naming it after Atlantis.... Panic over the comet led to con men selling things like anti-comet pills and umbrellas to protect from the \u201cdeadly gas.\u201d Naturally, scientists even then pointed out how ludicrous that is, and Halley\u2019s Comet passed without incident, but the snake oil salesmen of the day still made a killing.... ## #6: Napoleon Attacked by Rabbits\n\n(1807)\nNapoleon Bonaparte was a brilliant military commander. While his final defeat was at Waterloo, his most humiliating one was against small, long-eared bunnies. According to the story, in July 1807, Bonaparte arranged for a rabbit hunt. However, rather than wild animals, Napoleon\u2019s chief of staff elected to round up tame rabbits \u2013 anywhere from several hundred up to 3000, so the story goes.... And when the time came for the hunt to begin, instead of running away, the rabbits charged Napoleon and his men en masse, hoping for food and leaping and climbing all over them. The French emperor had to retreat to his carriage and make a hasty getaway!... ## #5: The Polish Army\u2019s Enlisted Bear\n\n(1942-63)\nWhile transporting refugees West from Iran in 1942, the 22nd Artillery Supply Company of the Polish Army encountered an orphaned Syrian brown bear cub, which they subsequently adopted as a mascot. Named Wojtek, this bear grew up traveling alongside soldiers, wrestling with them and imitating their behaviors, including enjoying beer and cigarettes.... ## #4: The Father of Tragedy\u2019s Tragic/Comic Death\n\n(456 or 455 BC)... Aeschylus is often regarded as the progenitor of the Greek tragedy, since his few surviving works are the earliest examples known to modern scholars. Greek tragedies often feature characters whose deaths are ironic twists of fate. Aeschylus\u2019 own fate is certainly a twist, though it\u2019s more comic than tragic. When returning to Gela in Sicily, Aeschylus died outside the city.... ## #3: Straw Hat Riots\n\n(1922)\nNew Yorkers have gotten angry over some weird stuff, but hats is one of the strangest. In the early 20th century, it was considered a fashion faux pas for men to wear a straw boater hat after September 15th. If they did, they were often subject to public ridicule or having their hats knocked off.... When some enthusiastic kids started the tradition a few days early on some dock and factory workers, it sparked a series of riots that lasted over a week! Mobs of youths destroying hats roamed the city! While there were thankfully no deaths, there were still an unfortunate number of people injured and arrested \u2013 over hats! America was in the midst of Prohibition, so men were probably pretty angry already\u2026... ## #2: 1904\u2019s Crazy Olympic Marathon\n\n(1904)\nTo call the 1904 St. Louis Olympic marathon a disaster would be an understatement of epic proportions! Of the 32 competitors, only 14 finished. This was largely due to organizer James E. Sullivan\u2019s insane belief that dehydration was good for the body, causing him to only have one water station in the nearly 25-mile race.\n\nTitle: Random events of history over the years. timeline.\nURL: https://www.timetoast.com/timelines/random-events-of-history-over-the-years\nSnippet: 476\n\n# Western Roman Empire Falls\n\n\n\nSep 20, 622\n\n# Prophet Mohammed arrivied in Median\n\n\n\nAug 28, 1189\n\n# Crusaders begin the siege of Acre\n\n\n\nSep 8, 1492\n\n# Columbus fleet sets sail westcolumbus sets sail from spain to discover new land.\n\n\n\nSep 6, 1522... # Magellan's expedition circumnavigates the Globemagellan sets sail to go around the world but he died before he could.\n\n\n\n# U.S. constitution signed\n\n\n\n# Napolean battles in RussiaNapolean didn't think things threw so he arrivied in Russia during the winter and many of his men died..\n\n\n\n# U.S.A gets the nick name \"Uncle Sam\"... # First Carpet Sweeper patenled\n\n\n\n# First speeding ticket\n\n\n\n# Lascaux cave paintings discoveredthese cave paintings were discovered in france by a group of kids.\n\n\n\n# Mao Zedong outlines the new chinese government\n\n\n\n# Central High School Integrated\n\n\n\n# Castrp arrives in New York\n\n\n\n# Israeli athletes killed at Olympics... # Israel Palestine peace accord signed\n\n\n\n# Attack on Americaduring 9-11 four airplanes were high jacked by israel terrorisits\n\n\n\n# Hurricane Katrina slams into Gulf coast\nThe Emu War (1932) is one of Australia's most bizarre events, where a small group of soldiers was dispatched to Western Australia to combat an invading population of emus. The large, flightless birds had been damaging crops and causing considerable damage during the Great Depression, prompting the Australian government to take action. Despite army efforts, which included the use of machine guns, the emus proved to be surprisingly difficult to control, leading to a humorous and somewhat embarrassing outcome for the military.",

      "text": "In the early 1930s, Australia faced one of its most challenging periods, grappling with the Great Depression. As farmers struggled to grow wheat, they inadvertently attracted a new foe: the emus. These large, flightless birds, drawn by the abundance of crops, began to wreak havoc on the fields, trampling down what little farmers had left. Frustrated and desperate to protect their livelihoods, the government decided to take action against this feathery invader.",

Armed with machine guns and a sense of purpose, the soldiers set out to restore order to the farmlands. However, little did they know that they were about to face an adversary far more cunning than they had anticipated.",

They moved with surprising speed and agility, splitting up into smaller groups to evade capture. Each attempt at a coordinated attack fell short, leading to a series of comical encounters. The emus, unbothered by the soldiers' attempts, continued to invade fields, leaving behind a trail of destruction.",

      "text": "After several weeks of attempting to subdue the emu population, the military found itself in a position they had not expected: being outsmarted by birds. Out of approximately 10,000 emus, only a few hundred were killed, leading to a witty remark that the emus had won the war. The operation was eventually deemed a failure, and the soldiers returned home, a mix of embarrassment and bewilderment etched on their faces.",

      "text": "The Emu War remains one of Australia\u2019s most peculiar chapters in its history. It's not just a tale of a military intervention but a humorous reminder of the unpredictability of nature. The emus continued to thrive, and farmers learned to adapt, turning to fencing and other methods to protect their crops. Today, the Emu War serves as a lighthearted anecdote of what happens when human ingenuity meets the resilience of nature.",
