So, if you're prone to going the rabbit hole of history, be warned: the entries in this thread might cause an involuntary obsession.\n\nThis post may include affiliate links.\n\nThe persecution and extermination of native Americans, and the annexation of their lands by the US government. Probably the most shameful chapter of US history and most people don't even know about it.... The Bronze Age Collapse.\n\nAround 1200 BC, every sophisticated culture around the Mediterrean fell apart. The Greeks, the Hittites, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians, everyone. They were either completely wiped out or decimated to the point where it would take centuries to recover.\n\nNo one knows exactly what happened, but there are vague references to \"sea people\" and famines and droughts. The Iliad and the Exodus may both be a twisted race memory of this event.... Eugene Johnson, a civilian virus hunter working for the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), organized an expedition to Kitum Cave in 1988. The U.S.-Kenyan mission consisted of 35 members and also employed sentinel animals, guinea pigs and monkeys, placed in the cave to reveal the possible presence of the virus; some cages were placed directly under the bat colony.... Befor the 1950s, snowmen were more often on the elaborate side, created by artists as art for art's sake, but also used for things like protesting (like the miracle of 1511). The man who sculpted Abraham Lincoln's tomb created a stunning snow and ice statue in 1857 that became very famous.... The dancing plague of 1518, or dance epidemic of 1518 was apparently a case of dancing mania that occurred in Strasbourg, Alsace [now modern-day France] in the Holy Roman Empire from July 1518 to September 1518. Apparently somewhere between 50 and 400 people took to dancing for weeks. There's too many theories behind what happened and the most popular one is a stress-induced mass hysteria... Other theories include ergot and there's a lot of controversy about how many deaths there actually were.... Unit 731 is so fascinating. America gets absolutely no education of biochemical warfare/human experiments past the h*******t.\n\nLately, it's been Teddy Roosevelt, particularly an expedition he led in 1913-1914 to map out a newly discovered river in the Amazon basin. S**t went absolutely sideways and Teddy nearly died! Check out an excellent book by Candice Millard titled *The River of Doubt*....

The largest labor uprising in American history and the very first of two times America openly bombed its own citizens. There\u2019s a couple of fantastic documentaries on it, and highly recommend researching it further.... The Civil War. Mostly about Gettysburg.\n\nMass graves in Chicago.\n\nNo, this is not an isolated incident, there are multiple events.\n\nThe poor farm and insane asylum.\n\nConfederate soldiers.\n\nEven as recently as the 90's 68 unclaimed dead from the heat wave.\n\nI don't really go out of my way to keep looking, but I get little glimpses of historical stories and places and can't help but dig deep and suddenly we're in mass grave territory again.... The Nixon Administration. Amazing how a such cold cerebral and vindictive person with little charisma could get elected twice after losing twice in disgrace and have such extremes in terms of achievements and self inflicted wounds.\n\nThe Columbian exchange. I love food history and it's crazy learning how many staples originated in the Americas.\n\nJFK & MLK assassinations.

The Mississippi River ran backwards. Bells rang in Chicago. Windows broke in NYC. It was felt in Canada and Boston. And they typically happen every 160-200 years, so, we are due for another round of massive earthquakes, which spread damage further because the land is more compressed east of the Mississippi....

From the Boston Tea Party to the \u201cshot heard round the world,\u201d Washington\u2019s crossing of the Delaware River, and the Valley Forge winter, the American Revolution\u2019s pursuit of liberty was made meaningful by the founding document of the great American experiment in democracy.... ## 1790s: Whiskey Rebellion (1794)\n\nAs the new country began finding its feet, U.S. President George Washington sent troops to western Pennsylvania in 1794 to quell the Whiskey Rebellion, an uprising by citizens who refused to pay a liquor tax that had been imposed by Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton to raise money for the national debt and to assert the power of the national government. Federalists cheered the triumph of national authority, while members of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Republican (later Democratic-Republican) Party were appalled by what they saw as government overreach. More than two centuries later, the names and faces have changed, but the story is ongoing.... ## 1810s: Battle of New Orleans (1815)\n\nOn January 8, 1815, a ragtag army under the command of Andrew Jackson decisively defeated British forces in the Battle of New Orleans, even though the War of 1812 had actually already ended. News of the Treaty of Ghent (December 24, 1814) had yet to reach the combatants. The American victory made a national figure of future president Jackson and contributed to the widespread perception that the U.S. had won the war, but in truth the conflict was effectively a draw, and the issues that had brought it on were largely unresolved.... ## 1850s: Dred Scott Decision (1857)\n\nThe 1850s were awash in harbingers of the American Civil War\u2014from the Compromise of 1850, which temporarily forestalled North-South tensions, to John Brown\u2019s Harpers Ferry Raid, which ramped them up. Arguably, though, by stoking abolitionist indignation in an increasingly polarized country, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Dred Scott decision set the table for the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln as president, which ultimately precipitated secession and war.... ## 1860s: Battle of Gettysburg (1863)\n\nIn July 1863, the year of the Emancipation Proclamation, in the small Pennsylvania crossroads town of Gettysburg, Robert E. Lee\u2019s invading Army of Northern Virginia sustained a defeat so devastating that it sealed the fate of the Confederacy and its \u201cpeculiar institution.\u201d Within two years the war was over, and before the end of the decade the South was temporarily transformed by Reconstruction.... ## 1910s: Sinking of the Lusitania (1915)\n\nAs World War I raged in Europe, most Americans, including U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, remained determined to avoid involvement and committed to neutrality, though the U.S. economy had benefited greatly from supplying food, raw material, and guns and ammunition to the Allies. More than any other single event, the sinking of the unarmed British ocean liner, the *Lusitania*, by a German submarine on May 7, 1915 (killing, among others, 128 Americans), prompted the U.S. to join the war on the side of the Allies.... Leaving behind its isolationism, the U.S. became a global superpower, though by decade\u2019s end it would recoil from membership in the fledgling League of Nations.\n\nTitle: Project Ideas\nURL: https://ivypanda.com/blog/interesting-historical-events/\nSnippet: ## \ud83d\udd25 10 Interesting Historical Events\n\n- The Chernobyl Disaster \u2013 1986.\n\n- Cold War \u2013 1947-1991.\n\n- The Black Plague \u2013 1347-1348.\n\n- The French Revolution \u2013 1789-1799.\n\n- DNA Discovery \u2013 1869.\n\n- Revolution in America \u2013 1775-1783.\n\n- The First Flight \u2013 1903.\n\n- The Vietnam War \u2013 1955-1975.\n\n- Salem Witch Trials \u2013 1692-1693.\n\n- Wall Street Market Crash \u2013 1929.... - Christianity and Asceticism in the history of religion.\n\n- Women\u2019s status after the American Revolution.\n\n- The consequences of interaction in cultures and civilizations.\n\n- Abraham Lincoln\u2019s thoughts in American history.\n\n- The British mandates history: Jewish and Palestinian relations.\n\n- Role of the civilian population in World War I.\n\n- The Industrial Revolution and beyond: culture, work, and social change.... - World history: Enlightenment in society\n\n- Concept of imperial powers in history.\n\n- The major causes of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\n- History of Hitler\u2019s Nazi propaganda.\n\n- History of Russian Revolution in 1917.\n\n- The Dark Ages as the Golden Ages of European history.... - Picasso and his paintings in modern world history.\n\n- A social and political history of the United States.\n\n- European colonization impacts on the native American population.\n\n- Principles of liberalism and its connection to Enlightenment and conservatism.\n\n**Japanese occupation in Philipines.**Analyze the background of this event.

However, many lesser-known but equally interesting historical events have been left out of textbooks. While they may not have been as heavy or dramatic as wars or monumental discoveries, they played a significant role in shaping history.\n\nFor instance, while most know that the United States fought alongside its allies in World War I, few are aware that a single telegram prompted the U.S. to join the war. And how many can name the first baby of European descent born in the Americas? In these cases and others, hundreds of remarkable historical events were set in motion by smaller, often overlooked moments.... Explore nine of the most interesting historical events you\u2019re unlikely to find in your textbooks.\n## Interesting Historical Events: The Lost Colony Of Roanoke\n\nIn 1585, the colony of Roanoke was founded, in what is presently Dare County, N.C.\n\nThe colony was founded as one of the first attempts to establish a permanent English settlement in the New World.... Queen Elizabeth I sanctioned the mission, granting a charter to Sir Walter Raleigh to establish a colony. Raleigh was supposed to discover all the \u201cremote heathen and barbarous lands,\u201d and bring riches from the New World back to England. He was also supposed to establish a military base, to counteract the activity of the Spaniards, who were also set on pillaging resources from the Americas.... After a few initial exploratory expeditions, during which contact with two native tribes had been made, and a few bases had been established, Raleigh dispatched 115 colonists to establish a colony on the Chesapeake Bay. The colonists were lead by John White, a friend of Raleigh\u2019s who had been on one of the previous expeditions to Roanoke.... The colony was established and peace was made between the settlers and the Croatoan people. A baby was even born to White\u2019s daughter, the first child to be born in North America, named Virginia Dare.\n\nAs the year wore on, however, the settlers realized they were running out of supplies. John White, who had been named governor, elected to sail back to England, to replenish the supplies.... Upon his arrival, though, it became clear that he wasn\u2019t going to get back to Roanoke anytime soon. A major naval war had broken out, and Queen Elizabeth commanded that all ships be used to confront the Spanish Armada.\n\nFor three years, White fought in the war. Then, he was finally permitted to return to his colony.... But when he returned, the colony was nowhere to be found. Here\u2019s where this becomes one of history\u2019s most interesting events.\n\nNot a single person remained at the colony, though there was no sign of any struggle to indicate they had been raided. In fact, all of the houses had been taken apart, signaling that there had been no rush to leave.... Before he left, White had instructed the colonists that if they were ever in danger, or forced out or attacked, that they should carve a Maltese cross onto a tree or a fence post.\n\nAll that was left behind was the word \u201cCROATOAN\u201d which was carved into a post of the fence that had been built around the village. The letters C-R-O were also found on a nearby tree.... To this day, the mystery of the Lost Colony of Roanoke, as it has come to be known, is yet unsolved.\n\nMost historians believe that the colonists, running desperately low on supplies, turned to a local Native American tribe, the Croatoan people, for help, and eventually moved into their society. This theory holds the most merit, as it accounts for the word carved into the tree, as well as for the dismantled homes.... Other historians have proposed some less likely scenarios, such as Spanish invasion, murder by other Native American tribes, and even mystical explanations for the disappearance, though, of course, none of them have been proven.",
